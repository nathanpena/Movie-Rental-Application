# Vidly Movie Rental Application

This project showcases a movie rental application built using the .NET framework. It includes full-stack development of customer and movie management functionality, highlighting my skills in data processing, API development, and front-end rendering.

## Overview

The Vidly Movie Rental App is designed to handle customer and movie data, providing various features such as:
- Creating, editing, and viewing customer and movie records
- API endpoints for managing customer and movie data
- Integration with a relational database to store and retrieve data
- Role-based authentication and access control

### Skills Demonstrated:

- **Data Modeling**: The project involves creating models for customers, movies, membership types, and genres, showcasing my ability to design and manage data relationships in a structured manner.
- **API Development**: The RESTful API controllers handle customer and movie data, demonstrating my skills in developing scalable APIs for data manipulation and retrieval.
- **Front-End Rendering**: By using views with Razor syntax, I implemented dynamic front-end rendering of customer and movie data, displaying my ability to work on both back-end and front-end.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through both the UI and the API.
- **Data Integration**: This application integrates with a database to store and retrieve customer and movie data, a crucial aspect for data engineering tasks such as building ETL pipelines.

## Features

- **Customer Management**: The app allows users to add, edit, and delete customer records, with validation on the data inputs.
- **Movie Management**: Users can also manage movie records, including genres and availability.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a clean API to interact with the customer and movie data programmatically, ideal for data integration and automation.
- **Authentication**: Implements user authentication and role-based access control to secure the application.

## How This Applies to Data Engineering & Data Analyst Roles

- **Data Processing**: The application's backend involves data processing and transformation, which is essential for ETL processes in data engineering.
- **API Integration**: By building and consuming APIs, I demonstrated skills in integrating different systems and facilitating data exchangeâ€”a key aspect of data engineering and analytics.
- **Database Management**: Working with relational databases, creating schemas, and optimizing queries highlight my ability to manage large datasets and ensure efficient retrieval and storage of data, which is directly applicable to both data engineering and data analyst roles.
- **Automation and Reporting**: By integrating APIs and automating CRUD operations, I can streamline data analysis workflows and support data-driven decision-making.
